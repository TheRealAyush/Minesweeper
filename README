MINESWEEPER GAME - README
========================

DESCRIPTION
----------
This is a complete implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built in Java using the Impworld library. 
The game features a graphical user interface with mouse and keyboard controls, multiple difficulty levels, and several quality-of-life improvements.

GAME FEATURES
-------------
• Classic Minesweeper gameplay with left-click to reveal and right-click to flag
• Three difficulty levels: Easy (8x8, 10 mines), Medium (16x16, 40 mines), Hard (30x16, 99 mines)
• Real-time mines counter showing remaining mines
• Flood-fill behavior for empty cells (chain reaction reveals)
• First-click safety guarantee
• Game restart functionality
• Welcome screen for difficulty selection
• Visual feedback for game states (win/lose)

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
1. Game Controls:
   - LEFT CLICK: Reveal a cell
   - RIGHT CLICK: Place/remove a flag
   - R KEY: Restart the game (when game is over)

2. Game Rules:
   - Reveal all non-mine cells to win
   - Numbers show how many mines are adjacent to that cell
   - Empty cells (0 adjacent mines) automatically reveal neighboring cells
   - Avoid clicking on mines!

EXTRA CREDIT FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
================================

1. WELCOME SCREEN WITH DIFFICULTY SELECTION
   - Welcome screen with three difficulty buttons
   - Easy: 8x8 grid with 10 mines (green button)
   - Medium: 16x16 grid with 40 mines (orange button)  
   - Hard: 30x16 grid with 99 mines (red button)
   - Clear visual design with difficulty descriptions

2. FIRST CLICK SAFETY GUARANTEE
   - The first cell you click can NEVER be a mine
   - All 8 neighboring cells around your first click are also guaranteed safe
   - Mines are placed after the first click, ensuring a safe starting area
   - This prevents frustrating instant losses

3. MINES LEFT COUNTER
   - White scoreboard at the top of the game window
   - Shows "Mines Left: X" where X is the number of remaining mines
   - Updates in real-time as you place or remove flags
   - Formula: Mines Left = Total Mines - Flags Placed
   - Helps players track their progress and flag usage

4. GAME RESTART FUNCTIONALITY
   - Press 'R' key to restart the game after winning or losing
   - Creates a completely new mine layout
   - Resets all game state (revealed cells, flags, etc.)
   - Maintains the same difficulty level
   - Blue "Press 'R' to restart" instruction appears when game ends

5. FLOOD-FILL CHAIN REACTION
   - When you click a cell with 0 adjacent mines, it triggers a chain reaction
   - All connected empty cells are automatically revealed
   - Creates large revealed areas at once, just like classic Minesweeper
   - Stops when it reaches cells with adjacent mines
   
ENJOY PLAYING MINESWEEPER!
